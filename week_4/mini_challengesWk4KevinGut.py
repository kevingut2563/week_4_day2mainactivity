# Print the following text in uppercase, using the specific string method:
# "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
sentence = "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
print(sentence.upper()) #prints the senntence in uppercase 
sentence2 = "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
print(sentence2.lower())#prints the sentence in lowercase

print(sentence.find("communications")) 
print(sentence[25:39].upper())
print(sentence.replace("communications", "COMMUNICATIONS")) #prints the sentence word communications in uppercase 
print(sentence.replace("communications", "communications".upper())) #prints the sentence word communications in uppercase 

newsentence = "if the implementation is hard to explain, it might be a bad idea."
print(newsentence.replace("hard", "easy").replace("bad", "good"))

#split method
sentence4= "I am a python programmer"
print(sentence4.split())#splits sentence into a list of words 
#this prints out as ['I', 'am', 'a', 'python', 'programmer']
#by default, this method splits the sentence by commas 
print(sentence4.split(","))#splits the sentence into a lost if words using a separator
#this prints out as ['I am a python programmer']
print(sentence4.split("a")) #splits the snetence into a list of words using a separator 
#this takes out all the as in the sentence 
#it prints something like this ['I ', 'm ', ' python progr', 'mmer']

# String Methods Practice #2
# Join the following list into a string, separating each item with a space. Use the appropriate list/string method, and display the result.

# String Methods Practice #3
# Replace in the following sentence:
practice3="If the implementation is hard to explain, it might be a bad idea."
print(practice3.replace("hard", "easy").replace("bad", "good"))
# the following pairs of words:
# "hard" --> "easy"
# "bad" --> "good"
# and display the sentence with both words modified.

# String Properties Practice #1
# Concatenate the text "Repetition" 15 times and display the result on the screen.
# Luckily, you know that strings are multipliable and you can do this activity in a simple and elegant way.

resul= "Repetition" * 15
print(resul)

# String Properties Practice #2
# Check if the word "beach" is not found in the following haiku. You should print the boolean.
haiku="Whitecaps on the bay: A broken signboard banging In the April wind."
print(haiku.replace("bay", "beach"))
# â€” Richard Wright, collected in Haiku: This Other World, 1998

# String Properties Practice #3
# Check the Python Documentation to find the description of the len() function. Then, display on the screen the length (in number of characters) of the word electroencephalographist.
color = ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'orange', 'yellow']
